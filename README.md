🚗 **Car Price Predictor**
🔗 Repository: parthvasu2004/car_price_predictor_p
🚀 Overview
The Car Price Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that estimates the price of a used car based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, and kilometers driven. The application is built using Flask for the backend and Linear Regression for prediction.

🛠️ Features
✔️ Accurate Car Price Prediction based on historical data.
✔️ Machine Learning Model trained using Linear Regression.
✔️ Flask Web Application with an easy-to-use interface.
✔️ Interactive UI for entering car details.
✔️ Live Deployment on Render for real-time usage.

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ Enter Car Details – Provide specifications like year, fuel type, kilometers driven, and brand.
2️⃣ Predict Price – The model estimates the resale value based on the input.
3️⃣ Get Insights – Users can make informed decisions while buying or selling a car.

🔍 Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
Dataset: Cleaned car price dataset (Cleaned Car.csv).
Pretrained Model: Stored as LinearRegressionModel.pkl.
